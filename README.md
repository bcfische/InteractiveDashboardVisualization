Belly Button Biodiversity

The belly button is one of the habitats closest to us, and yet it remains relatively unexplored. In January 2011, Belly Button
Biodiversity was launched to investigate the microbes inhabiting our navels and the factors that might influence the microscopic
life calling this protected, moist patch of skin home. In addition to inspiring scientific curiosity, Belly Button Biodiversity
inspired conversations about the beneficial roles microbes play in our daily lives.

Here, we explore this dataset using Plotly.js to build interactive charts for a dashboard application, then deploy the Flask app
to Heroku.
